<!--
You are tasked with creating a piece of HTML dynamically using JavaScript and appending it to a given element
using a passed in selector.
Your function will receive a string value representing a selector (for example "#wrapper" or ".root"),
all elements created should be appended to the selector.
The HTML you create should contain 4 elements:
•	<textarea> with class="counter", value="0" and the disabled attribute.
•	<button> with class="btn", id="incrementBtn" and text "Increment".
•	<button> with class="btn", id="addBtn" and text "Add".
•	Unordered list <ul> with class="results".
When the [Increment] is clicked the value of the textarea should go up by one (if it was 0 it should become 1 e.t.c.).
When the [Add] is clicked a new list item (<li>) with text equal to the current value of the textarea should be added
to the unordered list.
Submit in the judge the JS code (implementation) of the above function. It may hold other functions in its body.
