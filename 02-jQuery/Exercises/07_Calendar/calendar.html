<!--
Write a program that generates a monthly calendar by given date.
It should be formatted as an HTML table with a caption for the month and year and headings for each column for the days of the week.
The current date must be highlighted with a different style than the rest of the table cells.
•	Current month and year are listed in a <caption> element with the month displayed as a full capitalized name and the year with all digits;
•	The first row contains headings for the days of the week, shortened to 3 letters: Mon, Tue, Wed, etc.;
•	Each week is a complete row – pad the week with empty cells (empty string as cell content) if the month doesn’t start on a Monday or end on a Sunday;
•	The table should contain only as many rows as needed – some months may need 6 weeks, others just 5.
Hints
•	JavaScript has a built-in Date object, which can be used to construct a date with arguments and then extract the current day of the week using the getDay() method. You can familiarize yourself with the object properties here: http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_date.asp
•	Try setting the day of the month to 0 and see what the result will be.
•	Notice that the passed in arguments in the example [15, 1, 2017] correspond to 15th January 2017
