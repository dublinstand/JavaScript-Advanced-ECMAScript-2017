<!--
You are tasked by Wikipedia to write a JS program that parses text according to their internal markup in the browser.
Your program will receive a selector to a paragraph of text and has to scan it for special symbol combinations that
denote specific style for the text that is enclosed in them.
For instance, text surrounded by double single quotes (''text'') must be displayed in italics. Look bellow for a full list of features.
Your function will receive a selector to an HTML element.
Markup
The following symbols must be recognized and parsed:
•	''text'' becomes <i>text</i> (two single quotes)
•	'''text''' becomes <b>text</b> (three single quotes)
•	=text=, ==text== and ===text=== become <h1>text</h1>, <h2>text</h2> and <h3>text</h3>
•	[[link]] becomes an anchor to /wiki/link with the same text, <a href="/wiki/link">link</a>
•	[[link|Text]] becomes an anchor to /wiki/link with the argument after the pipe as text, <a href="/wiki/link">Text</a>
Note all resulting hyperlinks are relative to /wiki
Constraints
•	There will be no overlapping markup, i.e. there won’t be bold text inside a heading or a link
•	All hyperlinks will only consist of valid characters
