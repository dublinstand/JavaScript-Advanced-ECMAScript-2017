<!--
Write a JS function that generates a form for managing a list of
items and inserts it in an HTML document by given selector (e.g. by div id).
Your function will receive two arguments – the first is a selector to an HTML element, the second is a Boolean value,
indicating whether the search function is case-sensitive. If set to true, searches are case sensitive, if set to false, or not set,
searches ignore casing.
The user must be able to:
•	Add a new item with specified string content.
•	Delete an existing element.
•	Search for all elements containing a given string.
Each of the controls must be in a separate div. Place the add controls inside a div with a class add-controls, and provide a label with the text
 “Enter text:”, an empty input field and an anchor with the class button applied to it. The anchor acts as an add button and when the user presses
  it, a new item must be added to the list, using the string in the input field as its name.
Place the search controls inside a div with a class search-controls, and provide a label with the text "Search:" and an empty input field.
When the user starts typing, the list of items should display only the items that contain the given string. The search is case-sensitive only
if specified with an argument. When nothing is entered, the list will contain all elements.
Place the result controls inside a div with a class result-controls and in a list of class items-list. Each element has the class list-item.
When the list is filtered with a search, all elements that need to be left out must be applied a style of display:none;. Don’t forget to remove
the style after the search string is removed!
Every element is composed of an anchor with inner text "X" functioning as a delete button and its name wrapped in a <strong> tag. The anchor
has the class button. When the button is clicked, the element is deleted from the list.
