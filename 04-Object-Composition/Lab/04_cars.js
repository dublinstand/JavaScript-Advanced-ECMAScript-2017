//Write a closure that can create and modify objects. All created objects should be kept and be accessible by name. You should support the following functionality:
//•	create <name> - creates an object with the supplied <name>
//•	create <name> inherits <parentName> - creates an object with the given <name>, that inherits from the parent object with the <parentName>
//•	set <name> <key> <value> - sets the property with key equal to <key> to <value> in the object with the supplied <name>.
//•	print <name> - prints the object with the supplied <name> in the format "<key1>:<value1>,<key2>:<value2>…" - the printing should also print all inherited properties from parent objects. Inherited properties should come after own properties.
//Input
//The input will come as an array of strings - each string represents a command to be executed from your closure.
//Output
//For every print command - you should print on the console all properties of the object in the above mentioned format.
//Constraints
//•	All commands will always be valid, there will be no nonexistent or incorrect input.
